## Introduction

Hello there! I'm William Damario Lukito, a passionate and motivated individual with a background in Telecommunications Engineering. I graduated from Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia, holding both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in the field. Currently, I'm on an exciting journey towards obtaining my Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree at La Trobe University, Australia. My research focuses on the fascinating realm of applying artificial intelligence to enhance the capabilities of IoT satellites. I'm grateful to be supported by the Australian SmartSat CRC during this enriching and rewarding PhD experience.
